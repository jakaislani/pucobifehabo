The next day, Elliott was arrested, and about a month later, Elliott was charged with first-degree manslaughter and leaving the scene of the accident.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>Elliott’s daughter, Shelby Binney, was a competitive cheerleader, and when she died, her cheer gym released a <a href=#>Facebook</a> statement. It read,</p><p>“[Shelby] was loved by everyone around her. She was a bright light in the gym, a hard-working athlete, and the best teammate you could ask for.
