With compromise and communication being the key tools to making it work, not everyone gets the memo.</p><p>This season, each couple seems to have hit their own rough patch. Mark and Lindsey , Noi and Steve keep circling around his job and , Olajuwon has and Jasmina, and Michael . But it looks like the latter might be on the right track after all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong><br></p><p>After speaking to the experts about their marriage, it looks like Jasmine and Michael have both been working on their communication. And it looks like it hard started to pay off. Not only have the fights between them decreased, but they also seem to be getting along better while allowing themselves to be more vulnerable around each other. And it looks like they might just be heading towards one of their most profound bonding moments yet.</p><p>With each of the couples visiting their childhood homes, Jasmine and Michael both visited each other, while reading out letters that they had written to their younger selves. Both of them have dealt with their fair share of heartache and hardship growing up, seeing that Michael lost his mother to cancer earlier on and his brother was shot as well, while Jasmina was abandoned by her parents. Growing up was not easy for them, and they both have admitted that it is why they have very different communication styles.</p><p>While reading out the letter he wrote to his younger self, Michael mentioned that he wished he had appreciated the time spent with his mother and had done more things with her when he had the chance. Jasmina spoke about how growing up was filled with turmoil for her, but school was an escape, seeing that she had a teacher who helped her cope with her difficult situation. The pair got extremely emotional while revisiting their past and were there to comfort each other.</p><p>Now, the question is, will this be enough to get them to say yes on decision day? While they both have acknowledged the progress that they have made, they have also noted that it might not be enough to want to stay married. Jasmina also spoke about a lack of physical attraction, which is certainly an important factor. So, will they be able to find the spark that has been missing? Looks like fans will just have to wait and see.</p><p>'Married At First Sight' Season 14 airs on Wednesday at 8p/7c.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZGbwG6%2FxJqqqKZdZoFuucicn5qdnGKupbDRnqqsnaNiurDAx56prGWUmq61tIyjmKylmaOubr7Orp6hZZOdtq2wx6imnQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./every-mtn-dew-flavor-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="14 Mtn Dew Flavors, Ranked">&larr;
