That paved the way for reality television fame on Total Divas in 2013, followed by their own spinoff Total Bellas in 2016, which has followed them through their relationships, including <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/style/total-bellas-wwe-divas-nikki-brie.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="when they were both pregnant at the same time" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">when they were both pregnant at the same time</a>.

Following that, when they were in third grade, their mom put them in separate classes to give them a bit of space. Though they shared a friend group, they had different best friends. Still, there was always a connection. “They could sense each other's feelings and would sustain similar injuries at the same time or within weeks of each other,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://archive.azcentral.com/thingstodo/events/articles/20100317bella-twins-enjoying-wwe-success.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="AZCentral wrote" data-vars-ga-product-id=7fa3bac3-82bf-4789-b38b-cbe0559b0599 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://archive.azcentral.com/thingstodo/events/articles/20100317bella-twins-enjoying-wwe-success.html data-product-url=http://archive.azcentral.com/thingstodo/events/articles/20100317bella-twins-enjoying-wwe-success.html data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-brand="Not a Subscriber?" data-vars-ga-product-price=$24.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=cd92a566-cd29-4ab8-9217-11e72a65ac1d data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Not a Subscriber?" class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">AZCentral wrote</a>. “They often finish each other's sentences.”</p><img alt="Brie Bella" title="Brie Bella" width=3744 height=5616 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-175616624.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Brie Bella; Photo: Lizzy Sullivan/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The sisters were both soccer stars</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soccer became one of their common outlets, as they both started playing in fifth grade and then continued playing competitively for 11 years. “I snapped my tibia on the field senior year in high school which wasn’t fun, but never stopped the love for soccer,” Nikki said on Fox Sports’ <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wwe.com/videos/the-bella-twins-reveal-how-soccer-has-influenced-them data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Soccer Tonight" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Soccer Tonight</a>.

Nikki joined the soccer team at San Diego’s Grossmont College, leading them to the Pacific Coast Conference championship. “I was being recruited by a professional league in Italy,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.muscleandfitness.com/muscle-fitness-hers/hers-features/how-wwes-bella-twins-became-sports-performers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Muscle & Fitness" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Muscle & Fitness</a>.

But by the next year, they signed with Florida Championship Wrestling, a developmental program of WWE.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The easiest way to tell them apart is by their face shapes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While they are identical, there are some slight differences between the sisters. “I have two beauty marks on my chest, and our faces are shaped differently,” Brie <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tpww.net/2009/12/how-to-tell-the-bella-twins-apart-trish-stratustwitter-lilian-note/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=told class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told</a> WWE Magazine. “We joke that I have more of a banana head, and Nikki has an apple head.

My sister and I were all about it — and sure enough, we felt so comfortable in front of the cameras,” she said.

At the heart of their differences was that they just weren’t on the same page about family, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/john-cena data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Cena class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cena</a> explaining to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/why-john-cena-cant-lose-198734/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> in 2016: “Just because everyone else is happy with children doesn’t mean that’s how I have to live.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He had committed to the idea by getting a vasectomy, but in April 2018, he told Nikki he’d reverse it to get her back. “Even in the end when he was willing to give me kids, I could just tell it's not what we wanted,” Nikki said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.today.com/popculture/nikki-bella-left-john-cena-so-he-wouldn-t-regret-t182269 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Better Together with Maria Menounos" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Better Together with Maria Menounos</a>. “To force someone to be a father… that's not what I want. I don't want to force someone to change.”</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">They love (and live in) Napa Valley</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the pandemic, both the sisters and their families made a major decision to move to one of their favorite places, California’s Napa Valley. "We majorly downsized. We wanted to be more simple,” Brie said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/home/brie-nikki-bella-moving-sisters-open-up-about-twin-decision-settle-napa/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Bellas Podcast" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Bellas Podcast</a> in October 2020. “You guys have always known how Bryan and I are, so we were just like, we need to get back to who we were before kids, and let's simplify our life and live more country, and we're doing it. And so we did it!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nikki said the global lockdown definitely spurred on the move: “I will say the one thing COVID taught me was to simplify my life, and in all areas...For me it was like seeing beautiful parts of the world, having amazing experiences and new memories with my family." And of course, they did it together, with Nikki adding: “It was definitely a twin decision — our poor guys!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYraCcmsGmv46noKSjmWKvs7XEZpmepJyWerXDyKeqZp6RmMG0</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-old-is-emma-heming-willis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How old is Emma Heming Willis?">&larr;
