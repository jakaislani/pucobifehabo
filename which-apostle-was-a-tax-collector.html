He was one of Jesus Christ’s twelve disciples and is often referred to as “Matthew the tax collector” in the Bible.</p><p>Matthew’s profession as a tax collector was despised by many in Jewish society during that time. Tax collectors were seen as collaborators with the Roman authorities, as they worked for the Roman Empire collecting taxes from their fellow Jews.</p><p>Despite his controversial occupation, Matthew’s encounter with Jesus Christ led to a transformative change in his life. When Jesus called him to be a disciple, Matthew immediately left everything behind to follow Him.</p><p>As a tax collector, Matthew was likely wealthy and had experience with record-keeping, which could have been beneficial in his later role as a writer of the Gospel of Matthew.</p><p>Matthew’s story serves as a powerful example of how no one is beyond redemption and how God can use anyone for His purposes, regardless of their past.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_the_role_of_tax_collectors_in_biblical_times></span>What was the role of tax collectors in biblical times?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tax collectors in biblical times were responsible for collecting taxes on behalf of the Roman Empire from the Jewish population. They were often viewed as traitors and extortionists because they collected more taxes than required and kept the extra for themselves.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_were_tax_collectors_despised_in_Jewish_society></span>Why were tax collectors despised in Jewish society?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tax collectors were despised in Jewish society because they were seen as collaborators with the Roman authorities, who were viewed as oppressors by many Jews. Additionally, tax collectors were often dishonest and took advantage of their positions to exploit their own people.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Jesus_association_with_tax_collectors_challenge_societal_norms></span>How did Jesus’ association with tax collectors challenge societal norms?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jesus’ association with tax collectors challenged societal norms by demonstrating God’s love and grace for all people, regardless of their profession or social status. By choosing to interact with and even call a tax collector like Matthew to be one of His disciples, Jesus showed that no one was beyond redemption.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_significant_about_Matthews_decision_to_follow_Jesus></span>What was significant about Matthew’s decision to follow Jesus?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Matthew’s decision to follow Jesus was significant because it showed his willingness to leave behind his old life as a tax collector and embrace a new life as a disciple of Christ. His transformation serves as a powerful example of repentance and redemption.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Matthews_background_as_a_tax_collector_influence_his_role_as_a_disciple></span>How did Matthew’s background as a tax collector influence his role as a disciple?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Matthew’s background as a tax collector likely gave him unique insights into the economic and social dynamics of the time.

It also reminds us that God can use anyone, regardless of their past, for His purposes.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_other_disciples_and_people_react_to_Matthews_conversion></span>How did other disciples and people react to Matthew’s conversion?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Other disciples and people of that time may have been initially skeptical or judgmental of Matthew’s conversion due to his previous occupation as a tax collector. However, witnessing his transformation and dedication to following Jesus likely inspired and challenged those around him.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Matthew_the_only_tax_collector_among_Jesus_disciples></span>Was Matthew the only tax collector among Jesus’ disciples?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Matthew is the only disciple specifically identified as a tax collector in the Bible.
