Kendall was a popular leader and motivator for many Concord students. Everyone in his network, from coworkers to friends to family members, has paid respect to the coach.</p><p>The Concord High Athletic Boosters sent a statement to honor the football coach. Kendall, they claimed, worked relentlessly to nourish and raise the pupils of Concord Middle School. The NC coach is survived by his mother, Caroline Bost, father, Donovan Flemming, and two siblings, Kailan and Kizziah.</p><h2>Concord NC Coach Kendall Bost’s Obituary</h2><p>Kendall Bost, a Concord Middle School teacher, died in an unfortunate event on Saturday. Kendall, a North Carolina native, wanted to coach the football team this fall. Kenneth McClamrock, a close friend, revealed in a Facebook post that Kendall had contacted him about his plans.</p><p>Kenneth stated that the middle school teacher had maintained outstanding communication with the parents of his students. Kendall graduated from Concord High School and played football on the varsity team. He graduated from Appalachian State University in 2018 with a degree in political science and government.</p><p>Kendall spent two years after graduation working as a material handler at S&D Coffee & Tea. He then enrolled in Concord Middle School in 2022. Kendall stays committed to his high school football team, as evidenced by a tweet from 2018. An X user, Concord Spider FB, shared a photo of Kendall directing the young football team.</p><p>The user commented, “Even during a break, Kendall Bost took a few minutes to explain to the JV linemen what it means to wear Concord on your breast! “It’s Special” features Coach Porter and Mrs. Porter’s daughter Riley soaking it all in.” The Concord community has organized a fundraiser for the deceased coach.</p><p>The $5,000 goal was surpassed within a few hours of the GoFundMe being shared on several social media platforms. Family and friends remember. Kendall, the football coach, was Caroline Bost’s first child with Donovan Flemming. The instructor has two younger siblings, Kailan and Kizziah.</p><h2>Family and Friends Remember The Football Coach</h2><p>Caroline was the one who first revealed that her son had perished in a tragedy. Caroline captioned a sweet photo of Kendall giving her a back hug, “I’ll love you forever and ever.” “I thank God for the time I spent with you, my sweet boy.”</p><p>She then released Otis Reading’s song The Dock of the Bay as a tribute to her son. Donovan also shared a collage for his child, which included a childhood photo of Kendall as well as a shot of him during his coaching duties. He wrote, “My firstborn child, I am at a loss for words. I may have been a bad person for most of my life, but I always wanted you, your sister and your brother to succeed in life.</p><p>In your 29 years, you were a finer man than I ever was, and while you were similar to me in many ways, you were unique; you were a man respected in life, and you will be greatly missed. My heart is destroyed. Kendall’s sister, Kailan, was always encouraging of her brother. Kendall even sent him a happy tweet when he started teaching at Concord in 2022.</p><p>Several of Kendall’s pals took to social media to pay respect to the former coach. Annie Elizabeth, his close friend, wrote, “If I had one wish, it would be for you to pay me another visit. “One more embrace.”We love you, Big BBK.”</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>coach</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Meet Andrea Giambruno | Moglie Giorgia Meloni And Figlia Ginevra Giambruno</a></h3>Italian journalist and television personality Andrea Giambruno is well-known for his work at Mediaset, a well-known network that Silvio Berlusconi built.
