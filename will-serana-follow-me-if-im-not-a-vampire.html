It's shame there is no option to kill her since that was my main goal when I started the quest: To destroy all vampires in Skyrim!</span></span><h2>Can serana still be a follower if you choose Dawnguard?</h2>You can have Serana continue to follow you once the quest line is over, and you will have 2 followers. You can even dismiss the second follower and pick up another instead while Serana continues to follow. Just never dismiss Serana and you can do this.<h2>How do I get serana to follow me again?</h2>You need to either talk to her and tell her to follow, or continue with the quest and when it finishes, then you can get her back again.<h2>What happens if you let serana make you a vampire?</h2>If you allow Serana to turn you into a Vampire Lord, you can enter without being harmed. Just make sure to complete the “Rising at Dawn” quest (the standard quest to cure vampirism, started by speaking to Falion in Morthal) before returning to Fort Dawnguard.<h2>Does serana know you are Dragonborn?</h2>She could have knowledge of the Dragonborn during the First Era. She could also be aware of the Last Dragonborn's status, but just shrugs it off with disinterest. That, or she may not completely understand a Dragonborn's abilities and thinks you're performing some sort of bizarre magic to her.<h2>Skyrim ٠ What Happens if you Come to Serana as a Vampire</h2><p></p><h2>How old is serana Skyrim?</h2>Serana looks to be in her mid to late 20's maybe early 30's during the events of Dawnguard. She states in in-game dialogue that she is surprised Dwarven ruins are uninhabited, however Bethesda revealed this as false and that they were just exaggerating. By the time she was born, the Dwemer have long since disappeared.<h2>How do I fix serana not following me?</h2>i had same issue. Only thing I found to work was loading a previous save. Press the button next to 1 on the top row of the keyboard to bring up the console, then type that string in and press enter, it should then allow you to get Serana to follow you once more.<h2>Is serana a good follower?</h2>Serana has a level of situational awareness that many Skyrim followers do not. As an essential character, she cannot die, which makes her an excellent choice as a companion. Her aggressive behavior can make sneaking difficult, but since she can't die, Serana makes a great decoy.<h2>Can serana be a companion?</h2>Serana is an ancient, pure-blood vampire and the daughter of Lord Harkon and Valerica. She is known as one of the "Daughters of Coldharbour," and because of this she is central to the main questline in Dawnguard. After being encountered, she can be recruited as a follower, unlocking a multitude of interactions.<h2>What happens to serana If you side with the Dawnguard?</h2>If you side with the Dawnguard, you can convince Serana to cure her vampirism after her father's death. This depends on selecting certain conversation options over the course of the questline. After Serana brings her scroll to Fort Dawnguard, you ask her "Have you always been a vampire?" while she is a follower.<h2>Who is the best companion in Skyrim?</h2><p>Skyrim: 10 Best Followers In The Game, Ranked</p><ul><li>8 Marcurio.</li><li>7 Aela The Huntress.</li><li>6 Barbas.</li><li>5 Mjoll The Lioness.</li><li>4 J'zargo.</li><li>3 Cicero.</li><li>2 Serana.</li><li>1 Flame Thrall.</li></ul><h2>Can you have 2 followers in Skyrim?</h2>You can only have one follower at a time: if you want a different one, you need to dismiss the first one before you recruit them. There is one exception to this: there are situations when you already have a follower when a person needs to join you for something quest-related.<h2>Can serana turn you into a vampire multiple times?</h2>Notes. Serana won't be able to turn you into a Vampire Lord if she has cured herself of vampirism. Show activity on this post. According to the wiki, Aela will only give you Lycanthrope once more if you cure it (with Dawnguard DLC), so there is a point of no return.<h2>Should I join Dawnguard or Volkihar?</h2>If your character is evil, side with Volkihar. If you're the good hero type, join the Dawnguard. In my opinion, I like much more Volkihar because I'm the bad type, you get a cool mage-ring (really, if you're a mage you must join Volkihar), and a bunch of amulets if you're vampire.<h2>Can you meet serana without joining Dawnguard?</h2>No. But you don't help them if you're a vampire do you? You agree to check out the cave with Vigilant Talos, but in the end you take Serana and her Elder Scrolls to Harkon and the Dawnguard gain nothing.<h2>Can serana be a Housecarl?</h2>No, it isn't. She doesn't have dialog recorded for this so you wouldn't even be able to force it with console commands.<h2>Where does serana go after cure?</h2>normally, she will return to FORT DAWNGUARD (I sided with the dawnguard), but she has been known to go anywhere.<h2>Is Faendal or Sven a better follower?</h2>Skyrim - Faendal Is A Better Follower Than Sven<p>He also has a level cap of 30, which while not phenomenal, will keep him relevant a good while longer than Sven, especially with his archery skills.</p><h2>How do I get into Castle Volkihar with serana?</h2>Fix 360: When Serana initiates the conversation about Castle Volkihar while still in the Crypt, finish it as normal and then DO NOT initiate any other conversation with her! Leave the Crypt and go to Volkihar Castle. (You might also get there by swimming instead of fast travel or using the Icewater Jetty.)<h2>How long has serana been asleep?</h2>She's been asleep for at least 2k yrs old. It would be funny if she fell asleep during the time period ESO is playing in. Would be even more awesome if the player character in ESO helped with that. She looks like in her early 20s.<h2>How tall is serana?</h2>Looking up actual race statistics on the Elder Scrolls Wiki, Serana, being a Nord, would be 6' 3". It's obvious she would tower over my nerdling body.<h2>Can serana wear heavy armor?</h2>Serana is capable of wearing both light and heavy armor, but the armor must be an upgrade over her default gear for her to equip it.<h2>How many times can AELA make you a Werewolf?</h2>Aela only turns you into one on two occasions. During the Questline, and after if you cured yourself. Only twice.<h2>Is Vampire Lord or Werewolf better?</h2>At lower levels, Werewolf is maybe a better choice, because it's easier to level up, and Vampire Lord won't have as many advantages. However overall, Vampire Lord is a complete power trip. At level 46+ you get an extra 250 health, 200 magicka and 100 stamina.<h2>Can you turn AELA into a vampire?</h2>Trivia. It is not possible to turn Aela the Huntress, Farkas, or Vilkas into vampires, as they are already werewolves. However, Vilkas and Farkas can be turned if they are cured from their lycanthropy. Any other member of the Companions or anyone else is turnable.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9aio6Vlo5q%2ForrAZp2opJykxG65xGagn2WZonqvu9NmmGaukaK9qr7E</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nikki-brie-bella-twins-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Things You May Not Know About the Bella Twins">&larr;
