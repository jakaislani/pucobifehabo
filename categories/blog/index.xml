We may safely assume that the moniker ‚ÄúMona Lisa‚Äù is more well known than the image itself. So how does it happen that the current world record price of US$140 million is for a piece named No?
Therefore, it is reasonable to inquire whether or not ‚ÄúWhistler‚Äôs Mother‚Äù is an authentic picture?
