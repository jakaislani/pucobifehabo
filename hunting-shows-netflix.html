We find a sense of purpose out there in the wild, where our only motive in life is survival. Two and a half million years ago, when men first lived on the surface of the Earth, their lives were far more different from the lives that we live today. Their priorities were simple yet not-so-easy and revolved around one core principle — only the fit shall <a href=#>survive</a>. They would spend days hunting down animals so that, at the end of the day, they could get enough nutrition.</p><p>Our lives are a lot more complex now, and our priorities keep shifting, but they don’t rely on survival directly. In fact, many of our priorities rely on worldly pleasures, and surviving has become much easier. However, if you want to quench your thirst for hunting, Netflix has some great, daunting, and thrilling hunting shows that are not only fun to watch but even help you gain some knowledge about nature.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>6. Southern Survival (2020)</h2><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=788899 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/southern-survival-2020-6/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Southern-Survival-2020-6-e1698441762137.jpg data-orig-size=1920,800 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Southern Survival (2020) 6" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Southern-Survival-2020-6-e1698441762137.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Southern-Survival-2020-6-e1698441762137.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Southern-Survival-2020-6-e1698441762137.jpg alt width=1024 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Not all hunting shows show live hunting but explore different ways of doing so along with other ways of survival. One such show is ‘Southern Survival’ wherein The BattlBox crew creates and tests different kinds of outdoor survival gear to ascertain if they are effective or not. The fact that the show comes with the big, bold disclaimer ‘Don’t try this at home’ makes it clear that the audience will be watching a no-holds-barred treatment filled with destruction. So, if you like to watch things being destroyed (under controlled conditions), you will love this show. You can watch it <a href=#>here</a>.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>5.

It is a self-documented show, which means they are provided with some survival equipment and a camera to record all they go through, and they can choose to opt out at any point. The one to remain in the wild the longest wins a cash prize. Across the ten seasons, the show has taken its contestants to a wide range of remote places, including Patagonia, British Columbia, and Mongolia.
