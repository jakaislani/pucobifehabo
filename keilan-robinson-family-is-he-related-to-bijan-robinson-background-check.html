Regardless, both outstanding running backs have left their mark on the football field. This piece will look at the ancestors of these two athletes. Before we try to figure out what they have in common, let’s get to know each of them.</p><h2><span id=Know_More_About_Keilan_Robinson>Know More About Keilan Robinson</span></h2><p>Keilan Robinson, a senior running back at the University of Texas, is a native of Washington, D.C. Robinson established himself at St. John’s High School before donning the burnt orange of the Longhorns. According to 247Composite, he began his college career at Alabama in 2019 as a four-star recruit.</p><p>Similarly, in eight games during his first season, he had 34 carries for 254 yards and two touchdowns. Despite a promising start, Robinson elected to skip his second season due to the COVID-19 outbreak. He then chose to attend the University of Texas. This pick brought him back into contact with Steve Sarkisian, the former Alabama coordinator who is now the head coach of Texas.</p><p>Robinson was a game-changer for the Longhorns, and he has subsequently made a significant impact, winning multiple honors. He was named to the Reese’s Senior Bowl preseason watch list and was named an honorable mention All-Big 12 selection in 2022. Aside from football, he attends Texas and studies Communication and Leadership.</p><h2><span id=Meet_Bijan_Robinson>Meet Bijan Robinson</span></h2><p>Bijan Robinson, on the other hand, is a running back with the National Football League’s Atlanta Falcons. He is regarded as a potent offensive weapon who can make a significant impact in the passing game. Robinson, who was born in Tucson, Arizona on January 30, 2002, attended Salpointe Catholic High School. He was selected Arizona Gatorade Football Player of the Year as a senior, while also setting multiple state records.</p><p>Robinson, a five-star recruit, went on to excel at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2022, he won the Doak Walker Award and was named unanimous All-American. His strong performance earned him the eighth-round pick of the Atlanta Falcons in the 2023 NFL Draft.</p><h2><span id=Is_Keilan_Robinson_related_to_Bijan_Robinson>Is Keilan Robinson related to Bijan Robinson?</span></h2><p>Keilan Robinson and Bijan Robinson are not related, despite sharing the same surname and playing for the Texas Longhorns. Their connection is coincidental, and they have no family ties. On the other side, the bond built on the football field has created a sense of kinship and fraternity between the two players.</p><p>As teammates, Keilan and Bijan Robinson both made significant contributions to the Longhorns’ success. They both demonstrated their abilities on the field, amassing massive running yards versus opponents.</p><h2><span id=Family_Tree>Family Tree</span></h2><p>While they are unrelated, learning about the families of these two players is fascinating. Sherron Dunmore gave birth to Keilan Robinson in Washington, D.C. He does, however, keep family matters private, and little information about him is available online. Bijan Robinson, on the other hand, is LaMore Sauls’ eldest kid and a Tucson, Arizona resident.</p><p>His grandparents, Cleo and Terri Robinson, raised him. Bijan is Darius and Cleyrissa’s older brother. His younger brother, Darius Sauls, also plays football at Tucson High Magnet School. Meanwhile, his eldest brother’s sister, Cleyrissa Robinson, has taken over as Brand Manager.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Trending News</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Carlee Russell Jewish Or Christian | Religion Ethnicity And Origin</a></h3>Carlee Russell, 25, from Alabama is energetic and driven.
