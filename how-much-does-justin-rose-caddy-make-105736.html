At the start of 2019, his long-time caddie ‘Foochy’ had to have heart surgery which left him out of action for a number of months.</p><p>To put that in perspective, Justin Thomas’ caddie Jimmy Johnson made an estimated $270,000 in 2021, while Phil Mickelson’s caddie, Tim, who happens to also be his brother, made a reported $216,000. “Every caddie gets a weekly paycheck, no matter where his player finishes,” former caddie and ESPN analyst Michael Collins told Insider.</p><p>Justin Rose has earned total career earnings of $56,276,814, averaging $2,446,818 prize money per year. Justin Rose ‘s net worth is $56,276,814.</p><p>According to Golfing Addiction, these are the highest-paid caddies in 2017: 5. Kessler Karain: $610,000 Why does PGA golfer Patrick Reed trust his caddie Kessler Karain so much? Probably because Karain is his brother-in-law. Reed’s first caddie was his current wife and Karain’s sister, Justine.</p><h2>Who is the caddy for Thomas?</h2><p>This was only a fleeting partnership however as Thomas’ regular caddie has been<strong> Jimmie Johnson.</strong> Johnson had previously been caddying for American Steve Stricker, before the American had to reduce his playing schedule due to his back surgery.</p><p>Related: Who is Justin Thomas’ Girlfriend.<strong> Johnson</strong> has been a caddie for around 25 years now since 1995 and has previous experience of caddying for Nick Price, Charles Howell and Steve Stricker. In other words he is considered a veteran amongst today’s caddie ranks, being in his sixties.</p><p>A player who has had a fast meteoric rise up the world golf rankings, Justin Thomas has had<strong> 14</strong> PGA Tour titles including a Major title and a Players championship. Who carries his bag?</p><h2>How much money does Justin Rose make in 2020?</h2><p>Top professional golfers can make considerably more from endorsements than they ever could on the course. Take Justin Rose, the British golfer who is ranked ninth in the world. He won more than<strong> $4 million</strong> last season. Yet Morgan Stanley paid him $5 million to wear its name on his hat, while his golf shirt has logos …</p><p>Image. Chris Paisley planned a shot with his caddie,<strong> Sean Russell,</strong> at a 2015 tournament in Germany. Credit… Paul Thomas/Getty Images. Sponsors who have signed up include Maui Jim, a sunglasses company, and Sport Mobile, a phone service aimed at professional athletes.</p><p>Caddies on the PGA Tour won the right to sponsorship money after about<strong> 80</strong> caddies sued the tour in 2015 seeking $50 million a year in sponsorship dollars. Lawyers for the caddies argued that they were being unjustly exploited by being forced to wear bibs bearing the tournament’s sponsor without being compensated.</p><p>Yet Morgan Stanley paid him<strong> $5 million</strong> to wear its name on his hat, while his golf shirt has logos from Mastercard on his collar and Bonobos, the clothing company, and the Zurich Insurance Group on each sleeve. Until now, only a few caddies with wider name recognition, or at least easily remembered nicknames like Fluff (Cowan) and Bones (Mackay), …</p><p>The caddies’ association, which represents<strong> about 130 caddies, worked with the European Tour to create guidelines for sponsorship.</strong> The goal was to give caddies, who work as independent contractors for their players, not for the tour itself, an additional source of income.</p><p>Until now, only a few caddies with wider name recognition, or at least easily remembered nicknames like<strong> Fluff (Cowan) and Bones (Mackay),</strong> have benefited financially from their on-camera presence.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Of course<strong> the caddies are not the ones swinging the clubs.</strong> But if some portion of a player’s advertisement value is tied to how much time he is on camera, then the person standing next to the endorsement-clad golfer would logically have some value.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGifqK9dosKktIydpp6rXZ%2FCtMDIp2Srp6OaeqStw52wZqWRoLJufY9ubmxuXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ka-yu-janne-genzi-tanuki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ka-yu (Janne Da Arc)?[]">&larr;
