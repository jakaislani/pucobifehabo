Throughout its run, the series has introduced a large number of characters who are crucial to the storyline. While some of the characters stayed true to their personas and characteristics, others were surprising.</p><p>While some were unexpected in their temperament, some were much more so in their combat style. Let’s take a look at a few of the series’ most surprising characters.</p><p>Note that the list is not in any specific order and is based on the author’s own ideas. Some of the Naruto series’ most surprising characters</p><h2>1) Kakashi</h2><p>Because of the Sharingan and his ability to replicate jutsus with ease, the Copy Ninja acquired a bit of a reputation. When it comes to fighting, he is incredibly clever and carefully analyses the situation before engaging.</p><p>He’s also the sort that doesn’t mind going off the beaten path while battling against other characters, which makes him unpredictable in some confrontations.</p><h2>2) Naruto</h2><p>Naruto is a character that isn’t particularly bright to begin with. However, there are a few unusual moments where he makes good selections that aren’t expected.</p><p>Fans were also surprised by his choice of Jutsu during the duel against Kaguya Otsutsuki. He employed the reverse Harem Jutsu, which gave him and his teammates an opening to beat her.</p><h2>3) Danzo</h2><p>When a catastrophic occurrence occurred in the series that Danzo had planned, no one suspected he was the mastermind behind it. The Uchiha Massacre was one of the most heinous acts he was involved in.</p><p>He also managed the Root organization, where he trained shinobis to become some of the world’s most brutal killers. He was always plotting and devising incredibly violent ideas, which he justified by claiming were in the best interests of Konohagakure.</p><h2>4) Orochimaru</h2><p>Orochimaru was one of the series’ most clever and malevolent villains. He, too, was always seeking new methods to gain power, and he typically ended up killing a few people in the process.</p><p>During the course of the series, he was on the lookout for a vessel, causing havoc with the chunin examinations and even invading Konoha. Orochimaru was a master of deception, and much of what he accomplished was unexpected.</p><h2>5) Kabuto</h2><p>Kabuto walked in his master’s footsteps and constantly seemed to be up to something. He, too, was responsible for a large number of killings and frequently provided Orochimaru with test subjects.</p><p>Sage Mode’s mastery was one of the most unexpected things he accomplished. This was something few people could achieve, and it demonstrated his full shinobi potential. Kabuto is one of the series’ most underappreciated characters.</p><h2>6) Tobirama</h2><p>Tobirama was a formidable shinobi, and the Uchihas were wary of him. Tobirama had the same feelings towards them. Madara was always unsure of how he would deal with the Uchiha family.</p><p>Tobirama was also a brilliant inventor, having created some of the most complex jutsus, such as the Edo Tensei and Flying Raijin. When he appeared on TV, especially during a battle, no one knew what he would do.</p><h2>7) Hiruzen</h2><p>Because of his ability to conduct jutsus and general power, Hiruzen was called the God of Shinobi. However, he didn’t really show off his abilities throughout the series, so fans were constantly curious about them.</p><p>He was unexpected in that way since fans had no idea what tactics he had in his armory that he might deploy during a battle.</p><h2>8) Gaara</h2><p>Gaara was highly unstable and unpredictable before the One Tail was pulled from him. Shukaku would frequently take possession of Gaara’s body, causing him to act out without being able to control his feelings.</p><p>His presence at the chunin tests was particularly frightening, as he appeared to be a psychopath with a strong desire for blood. He dispatched everyone who stood in his way, and he was on the verge of dispatching Rock Lee as well.</p><h2>9) Tobi</h2><p>Tobi appeared to be fairly unstable during the series before it was discovered that he was Obito. He might be smiling at a joke one moment and then viciously killing someone the next.</p><p>Tobi was always unpredictably unpredictable, and no one knew what he was going to do next. During the series, he also had a few humorous moments since his interactions with his fellow Akatsuki members were also pretty amusing.</p><h2>10) Sasuke</h2><p>While circumstances may have influenced his actions, Sasuke’s sides shifted quite a bit. He allied with Orochimaru at first but chose to betray him, almost murdered Sakura twice before marrying her, and came dangerously close to murdering Naruto before saving him from the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Sasuke was highly unexpected in this regard throughout the series.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilmqqlqby0edGepWaln6jBbr%2FUq6eroaOeu6h5wqGYq5mTqbKzv44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sonya-eddy-weight-loss-heres-how-general-hospitals-epiphany-shed-the-pounds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sonya Eddy weight loss: Heres how General Hospitals Epiphany shed the pounds">&larr;
