As the 20th U.S. president, Garfield's agenda of civil service reform and civil rights was cut short when he was shot by a disgruntled office seeker in July 1881.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">James Abram Garfield was born on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, Ohio. Garfield's father, a wrestler, died when Garfield was an infant.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garfield excelled in academics, particularly Latin and Greek. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later renamed Hiram College), and later enrolled at Williams College. After completing his studies, Garfield returned to the Eclectic Institute as an instructor and administrator. In his spare time, he spoke publicly in support of the Republican Party and abolition. On November 11, 1858, Garfield married Lucretia Rudolph, a former pupil. They ultimately had seven children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1859, Garfield began to study law. At the same time, he embarked on a career in politics. He was elected to the Ohio State Senate in 1859, serving until 1861.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Civil War and Congressional Career" data-anchor-id=civil-war-and-congressional-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Civil War and Congressional Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the summer of 1861, Garfield was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Union Army. Later that year, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general, commanding a brigade at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garfield's political career continued during wartime. In October 1862, he won a seat in Congress, representing Ohio's 19th Congressional District. After the election, Garfield relocated to Washington, where he developed a close alliance with Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. Garfield became a member of the Radical Republicans, led by Chase, and found himself frustrated by moderates including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/abraham-lincoln data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Abraham Lincoln" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Abraham Lincoln</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garfield not only favored abolition but also believed that the leaders of the rebellion had forfeited their constitutional rights. He supported the confiscation of southern plantations and the punishment of rebellion leaders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following President Lincoln's assassination, Garfield attempted to ameliorate the strife between his own Radical Republicans and the new president, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/andrew-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andrew Johnson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andrew Johnson</a>. When Johnson undermined the Freedman's Bureau, however, Garfield rejoined the Radicals, subsequently supporting Johnson's impeachment.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title=Presidency data-anchor-id=presidency class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Presidency</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garfield was nominated as the Republican candidate for the presidency in 1880 as a compromise. The deeply divided convention nominated <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/chester-a-arthur data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chester A. Arthur" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chester A. Arthur</a>, a Stalwart Republican, for the vice presidency. Garfield and Arthur were narrowly elected to office over Democratic candidate Winfield S. Hancock, winning the popular vote by less than one-tenth of one percent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Office-seekers besieged Garfield immediately following his election, convincing the new president of the importance of civil service reform. During his limited time in office, Garfield managed to initiate reform of the Post Office Department, and to reassert the superiority of the office of the president over the U.S. Senate on the issue of executive appointments.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garfield also pledged to commit himself to the cause of civil rights. He recommended a universal education system funded by the federal government, in part to empower African Americans. He also appointed several former slaves, including Frederick Douglass, to prominent government positions.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 title="Assassination and Death" data-anchor-id=assassination-and-death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Assassination and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Another office seeker, 39-year-old Charles J. Guiteau, grew resentful over repeated denials to his requests. On July 2, 1881, just 100 days after the president's inauguration, Guiteau shot Garfield in the back at Washington's Baltimore and Potomac train station. He immediately surrendered to authorities, announcing, "I am a Stalwart. Arthur is now president of the United States.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garfield clung to life as doctors tried to remove the bullet, their repeated attempts with unsterilized fingers and instruments ultimately doing more harm than good. Meanwhile, his administration was torn on how to proceed, with Arthur refusing to take over executive duties.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garfield finally succumbed to a fatal heart attack, massive hemorrhaging and blood poisoning on September 19, 1881, his 199-day term the second shortest in U.S. presidential history. He left behind his wife, Lucretia, and their five children who had survived infancy.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: James Garfield</li><li>Birth date: November 19, 1831</li><li>Birth State: Ohio</li><li>Birth City: Orange Township</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Williams College</li><li>Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (Hiram College)</li></ul><li>Death date: September 19, 1881</li><li>Death State: New Jersey</li><li>Death City: Elberon</li></ul>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
