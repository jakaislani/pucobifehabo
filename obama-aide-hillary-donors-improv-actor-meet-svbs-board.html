The group is now composed of seven men and five women, or 41% female.</p><p>The group’s lack of banking expertise is likely to be a focus for investigators. Just one current member has had a career at the top of the investment banking world.&nbsp;</p><p>What is clear is that the bank, and much of the board, burnished their Democratic credentials as part of their strategy.</p><p>They donated to Obama, Clinton and President Biden, and to local Democratic congressional reps including Pelosi —&nbsp;as well as political action committees for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a longtime member of the powerful Senate Banking Committee.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">One of SVB’s board of directors, Garen Staglin, owns a vineyard in California’s Napa Valley near one owned by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (above). <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Such contributions went hand in hand with the bank’s business model.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everyone knew it was the go-to bank for woke CEOs,” one source told the&nbsp;New York Post. “They knew they were aligned politically. The companies&nbsp;SVB loaned money to all had a woke agenda.”</p><p>Here’s a who’s who of the failed SVB board:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘I prayed at a Shinto shrine after Hillary lost’</h2><p>Director Kate Mitchell, 64, is a Hillary Clinton mega-donor&nbsp;who was so upset by Donald Trump’s 2016 victory that she went to a shrine in Kyoto that Thanksgiving.</p><p>“I prayed for me and us to get beyond our grieving and shock and to figure out how to engage and listen to what happened and come back together,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mitchell told CNBC</a>.</p><p>The prayers came after she had donated $50,000 to the Hillary victory fund.</p><p>Prior to the election, Mitchell celebrated how 97% of technology company employees’ donations were going to Clinton.</p><p>“Ninety-seven percent support of Clinton is mind-blowing and really suggests that we’re pounding the table,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mitchell told NBC News</a>. “We think her business policies are going to be friendlier.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Kate Mitchell donated $50,000 to Hillary Clinton campaign fundraising in 2016. <span class=credit>Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Mitchell was a prolific donor in 2016, but much less generous in 2020, donating only $593.33 each to Democratic parties in Minnesota, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p><p>A veteran venture capitalist who co-founded Scale Venture Partners, Mitchell has been on the SVB board since 2010.</p><p>She’s been an outspoken advocate&nbsp;for venture capital, chairing the National Venture Capital Association and traveling frequently to Washington, DC, to lobby for Silicon Valley.</p><p>She also takes credit for co-authoring legislation on initial public offerings in 2012 that made it easier for start-ups to get publicly traded.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Mitchell was so disheartened by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election loss that she prayed at a shrine that Thanksgiving holiday in Kyoto, Japan. <span class=credit>AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>The San Francisco resident also prides herself on championing diversity, co-founding VentureForward, which focuses on “advancing opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities in the venture ecosystem.”</p><p>And despite the largest failure of corporate governance at a bank since the 2008 financial crisis, Mitchell advises the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford Law School</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learned how to be a boss from doing improv</h2><p>Board member Elizabeth “Busy” Burr splits executive success — she’s now the interim CEO of RiteAid after Heyward Donigan exited in January — with a rare hobby: improvisational theater.</p><p>The 61-year-old credits being in an improv troupe for taking her to the top.</p><p>“I’ve learned a lot from doing improv and it’s influenced how I think about leadership,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Authority Magazine</a>&nbsp;in February 2021 before joining SVB’s board months later in November.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Elizabeth “Busy” Burr has been doing improv for more than 10 years, including as a performer with the Bay Area group called Subject to Change. <span class=credit>@thebusyburr/Twitter</span></figure><p>Her woke credentials are not in doubt. In the same interview, she detailed how&nbsp;she saw her role as director as being about forcing companies to embrace diversity.</p><p>“It’s not enough to just report the numbers, instead, we need to demand a deep look at company culture — what are the informal networks and behaviors that support the status quo,” Burr said. “Discuss this at the board level and hold management teams accountable for real change.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Winemaker who toasts neighbor Nancy&nbsp;Pelosi</h2><p>Garen K.

Miller.</p><p>The 67-year-old was Obama’s under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department from March 2012 to September 2014.</p><p>In her role, she implemented the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation that set the regulatory framework in which SVB operates — meaning she would have expert insight into the thinking of regulators dealing with the now-shuttered bank.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Mary J. Miller served as the Treasury’s under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department in the Obama administration. <span class=credit>Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></figure><p>But her own attempt at a political career ended in disaster in 2020.</p><p>A longtime Baltimore resident, Miller ran to become the Charm City’s mayor in 2020, but finished third in the Democratic primary after an extraordinary race row.</p><p>A political action committee working on Miller’s behalf sent an explosive email to potential donors saying her campaign strategy was to target white voters — which would leave the two African American candidates to split the city’s majority black vote and clear her a path to victory, local station&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WBFF reported</a>.</p><p>Confronted with the email two months&nbsp;before the&nbsp;primary, Miller insisted that the PAC — Citizens for Ethical Progressive Leadership — had nothing to do with her, saying in a mea culpa: “This is not who I am.”</p><p>It did not help: Miller limped in with just 15.6% of the vote among Democrats.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The only real banker on board</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Tom King is the only “real” banker on the board. <span class=credit>Reuters</span></figure><p>Tom King, 63, SVB’s newest director, is the only&nbsp;board member with a career at the pinnacle of the banking world.</p><p>He spent 35 years in investment banking,&nbsp;much of it at Citigroup before joining Barclays in 2013.</p><p>While at Barclays, King was the CEO of investment banking.
