I remember leaving the theatre promising myself that one day I would have a go at this play and then pretty much forgot it for 50 years.”&nbsp;<strong>– Patrick Stewart</strong></p><p>“All I ever wanted to do was be on stage, if possible acting in Shakespeare. And to be as good as I could be. There was nowhere else I wanted to go. The TV was of no interest. Films were just a fantasy. Yet I was convinced that when we found ourselves in that world of fantasy and sci-fi, it was our classical background and our training that equipped us for that larger-than life-world.”&nbsp;<strong>– Patrick Stewart</strong></p><p>“I heard police or ambulancemen, standing in our house, say, ‘She must have provoked him,’ or, ‘Mrs. Stewart, it takes two to make a fight.’ They had no idea. The truth is my mother did nothing to deserve the violence she endured. She did not provoke my father, and even if she had, violence is an unacceptable way of dealing with conflict. Violence is a choice a man makes and he alone is responsible for it.”&nbsp;<strong>– Patrick Stewart</strong></p><p>“At 12 years old in the dangerous world that I was in, with very difficult home life, I found the stage was the safest place to be. It was predetermined and predictable – and furthermore you got to be someone else. All the problems only began when you left the building.”&nbsp;<strong>– Patrick Stewart</strong></p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><h3><strong>How much is Patrick Stewart worth?</strong></h3><p>Patrick Stewart’s net worth is estimated to be $75 Million.</p><h3><strong>How old is Patrick Stewart?</strong></h3><p>Patrick Stewart was born on July 13, 1940, and is currently 82 years old.</p><h3><strong>How tall is Patrick Stewart?</strong></h3><p>Patrick Stewart’s height is 1.78 m, which is equal to 5 ft 10 in.</p><h2><span id=summary class=ez-toc-section></span><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Patrick Stewart is a prolific actor who has made a name for himself through his work on the stage, sitcoms, and Broadway.
